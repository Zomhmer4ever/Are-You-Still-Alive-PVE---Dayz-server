I tell ya a trip from the beach just doesn't get better than this, no wolves! HAHAH  Alright time to get ready, we should be somewhere in the area above survivor camp. Take this chute and jump. Hurry up now we've got more survivors to gather.  *** PUT THE CHUTE ON AS A BACKPACK - WHEN FALLING PRESS SPACE TO DEPLOY THE CHUTE - BEST TO DEPLOY WITHIN 5 SECONDS OR RISK LAG SPLAT - WASD TO CONTROL - W+SHIFT TO GO FASTER - PRESS H TO CUT THE LINE - TREES ARE BAD - LAND SLOW OR YOU WILL BREAK YOUR LEGS AND FEED THE WOLVES :) ***",
