Your base is in violation of server rules
It is to close to military areas
Check discord for the rules on bases.

Your base and gear will be deleted within
24hrs if you do not move it.

Also this is not a proper territory.
You must choose the "create territory"
option when placing your flag.

No territory = No robbery protection

Get this shit moved and have a nice day
